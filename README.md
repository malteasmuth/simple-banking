# simple-banking
A simple account managing program, written as an exercise in learning C.
As I stated on my personal site, I'm super interested in hardware-near programming, and learning C seems to me a good start :)
[Follow me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malteasmuth) on my journey!

## Features (just the basics)
- As a user, I can deposit money on my bank account
- As a user, I can withdraw money from my bank account
- For persistance, the program saves basic account info to csv file

## Possible future features
- make several users possible (login-functionality)
- allow for creation of a new user
- allow for transactions between users
